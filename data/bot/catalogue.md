In this file, we will list all the properties that we use in the sequencing of our chatbots and all the most common values that they can take. 
This document has to be read in understand and parallel to the main documentation: https://github.com/GhostWording/gw-config-apis/blob/master/data/bot/readme.md

- we list below the properties in alphabetical order
- under each property, their most common values will appear as a dependency
