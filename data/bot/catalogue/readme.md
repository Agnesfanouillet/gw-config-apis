In this folder, we will list all the **properties that take a set of predefined values** and for which the client and the writer need to be cautious in using.

This document has to be read in parallel to the main documentation: https://github.com/GhostWording/gw-config-apis/blob/master/data/bot/readme.md

### Note for the reader:
- we have created a file per property
- we will describe each property's behaviour
- under each property, their most common values will appear in alphabetical order
- we will describe each value's behaviour
- finally, we will make an example of how the property/value pair should work in a typical context

Beware: we do not list properties that take **unique or undefined values** !
Examples: "Id", "Title", "Command", "CommandLabel", "Name", "Steps", "Paths", "ElementValue", "Randomize"

These values' principles are described and examplified in the main documentation.
