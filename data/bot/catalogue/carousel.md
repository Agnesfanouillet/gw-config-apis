In the chatbots, we would like to display a carousel. **A carousel is a series of specific cards that the user can swipe horizontally**. These cards add a visual aspect to the replies, as they are made of a picture and text; in contrast quick replies are made of text only.


#### 1. User journey using a carousel

As a user, I see a question. "Which country would you like to visit next?"

Then, I see three choices, displayed horizontally: (1) Nepal, (2) Scotland, (3) Chile. These choices are made of:
a. A picture
b. A title
c. A subtitle
d. A label or button

It looks like the following:

 when I click on a card in a carousel (on any part of it - image or button), I trigger the next step in the sequence.
