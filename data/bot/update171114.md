## 1. What's new?

We listed the actions mostly specific to iOS and Android clients in a new file; we greatly reduced the number of property from the former format.

Here is a list of the old actions and their translation in the new format:
- RateUs -> becomes part of EmbedLink (no need to a specific action when only the link is different - now defined in the params)
- ShowTrendingMessages, ShowTrendingGifs, ShowDailyIdeas -> all become the same action ShowTrendingContent, with different parameters
- ShowImages, ShowCards (and OptionalFeedback in some way) -> are now all part of the same action ShowCards. The params of this ShowCards helps define we want to show a Gif, text, image or text+image
- CreateAnimatedEmoji, MessagesByRecipient, RedirectTo -> are now all part of RedirectTo
- Enable/DisableSingleMode -> are now part of the SetUserProperty action with ppSingle as a Parameters

We introduced two new actions:
- ShowCardsWithMenu
- ShowTrendingContentWithMenu
Both of these actions do the same things as ShowCards and ShowTrending, with one exception: after ShowCardsWithMenu and ShowTrendingContentWithMenu, the client should show a predefined menu.

SetReminder, ShowAdvert and ShowUsers remain the same simple actions

## 2. Why was this change necessary?

We had to translate the less common actions from the old format to the new one.


## 3. Where can I see it in the documentation?

For the moment, we can see it in the following documentation (examples and actual cases have to be written ASAP:
- in the Action documentation: https://github.com/GhostWording/gw-config-apis/blob/master/data/bot/catalogue/Actions.md
- in the SetUserProperty documentation: https://github.com/GhostWording/gw-config-apis/blob/master/data/bot/catalogue/SetUserProperty.md
