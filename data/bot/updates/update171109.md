## 1. What's new?

We changed the way we add parameters in the case of an action `"SetUserProperty"`. We now need to explicitely state the properties `"property"` and `"value"` for the pair of property/value that we want to send to the server.

## 2. Why was this change necessary?

When we need to set a user property, we need to use the action `"SetUserProperty"`. In the previous description of the action, we asserted that it should work as follows:

```
    ...
    {
        "Type": "Action",
        "Id": "20",
        "Name": "SetUserProperty",
        "Parameters": {
            "ppDecisionsAriseFrom": "Thinking"
        }
    }
    ...
```

Where "ppDecisionsAriseFrom" is implicitely set as the property we want to set and "Thinking" is also implicitely set as the value.

Instead, Sergey and Rui came forward with the following objection:
- historically, we have always explicitely stated what is the property and what the value is by using the properties `"property"` and `"values"`
- if we want to insert other properties inside this `"Parameters":{}`, we need to explicitely stated where the property we are setting and its value are

We therefore decided to adopt the following format

```
    ...
    {
        "Type": "Action",
        "Id": "20",
        "Name": "SetUserProperty",
        "Parameters": {
            "property":"ppDecisionsAriseFrom",
            "value": "Thinking"
        }
    }
    ...
```

Notice the changes? Look at line 38 and 39 vs line 17

Please make sure to use lowercase when writing `"property"` and `"value"`


## 3. Where can I see it in the documentation?

We had to actually integrate a video link in one steps of the example:
- in the Readme.md (https://github.com/GhostWording/gw-config-apis/blob/master/data/bot/readme.md), we made a couple of changes at 8.3.4 Action: SetUserProperty
a. we corrected the example line 436 and 437
b. we changed the content of lines 442, 443 and 444 to match the above description
- in the example files, the ppDecisionsAriseFromV5.json file has been edited accordingly: https://github.com/GhostWording/gw-config-apis/blob/master/data/bot/sequences/experiments/ppDecisionsAriseFromV5.json
