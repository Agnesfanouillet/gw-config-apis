## 1. What's new?

We added two actions to the catalogue/Actions.md list:
A. `"RateUs"`. This action redirects users to the relevant App Store
B. `"SetLocation"`. This action triggers a request for the user's location data

## 2. Why were these changes necessary?

For two reasons:
A. `"RateUs"`: because we couldn't use `"EmbedLink"`. Each client will redirect the user to the relevant App Store and it will change from one device to another. Therefore it is up to the client to know where it should redirect the user in the case of a `"RateUs"` action 
B. `"SetLocation"`: because some clients don't have an automatic access to the user's location data, especially when using third-party services like Messenger, Slack or Skype. We therefore needed an action to define the action of pulling that location data.

## 3. Where can I see it in the documentation?

You can see it here: https://github.com/GhostWording/gw-config-apis/blob/master/data/bot/catalogue/Actions.md where we added the items `"SetLocation"` and `"RateUs"`, as one would expect
