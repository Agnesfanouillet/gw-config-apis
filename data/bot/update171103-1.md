## 1. What's new?

We added a property `"Title"` in the `"Parameters"` of `Steps` of `"Type": "Video"`


## 2. Why was this change necessary?

Following Sergey's suggestion that we can't put videos into the chatbot, we came to the conclusion that, for both clients:
- we would need to send a link to the video
- we can't send a "naked" link, so we need a title
- we need to add a title, which will what appears on the user's screen, so that when the user clicks on this title, he/she is redirected to the video on Youtube (or elsewhere)

In practice, that would mean that we will add a Parameter in "Type": "Video" step
Here it is:

```
          {
              "Type": "Video",
              "Id": "10",
              "Parameters": {
                  "Title": "CÃ©line Dion - I'm alive",
                  "Source": "Youtube",
                  "Path": "NJsa6-y4sDs"
              }
            }

```

This way, we avoid sending pure links to the user.
We have also made the change to the reference file :) : https://github.com/GhostWording/gw-config-apis/blob/master/data/bot/sequences/experiments/AllMediaSergey-MediaPreference.json


## 3. Where can I see it in the documentation?

We had to actually integrate a video link in one steps of the example:
- in the Readme.md (https://github.com/GhostWording/gw-config-apis/blob/master/data/bot/readme.md), we slightly changed the order of the code on paragraph 6 and 7, so that the step containing the `"Type": "Video"` would be the last one
- in the reference file (https://github.com/GhostWording/gw-config-apis/blob/master/data/bot/referencefile.json), we added a line on line 78
