## 1. What's new?

We added a property `"ElementValue"` at the Command level to indicate, in analytics, whether a user choice is valuable to us.

## 2. Why was this change necessary?

In the previous sequence format, we used the property/value pari "StepValue": "true". Now that we are rolling out "Steps" as the basis of content packaging, it would be very confusing to use "StepValue" again.

Instead, Rui came forward with the following idea:
- each branch of the sequence tree, whether an output of the bot or an input of the user, should be called an Element
- therefore each `"Type": "Leaf"` or `"Type": "Node"` bit should be considered an element of the sequence
- as a consequence, we should name the analytics property linked to those Elements `"ElementValue"`

As an example, it could look like this:

```
    ...
    "Commands": [
        {
            "Type": "Leaf",
            "Id": "ChooseBeauty",
            "ElementValue": "1",
            "CommandLabel": {
                "en": "beauty",
                "fr": "la beaut√©",
                "es": "la belleza"
            },
            "Steps": [
                {
                    "Type": "Action",
                    "Name": "DoVote"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "Type": "Leaf",
            "Id": "ChooseIntelligence",
            "ElementValue": "1",
            "CommandLabel": {
                "en": "intelligence",
                "fr": "l'intelligence",
                "es": "la inteligencia"
            },
            "Steps": [
                {
                    "Type": "Action",
                    "Name": "DoVote"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
    ...
```

This is a simplified version of https://github.com/GhostWording/gw-config-apis/blob/master/data/bot/sequences/experiments/BeautyOrIntelligenceV5.json
We can see that there is an `"ElementValue"` right at the root of both `"Leaf"` elements.
*Note*: 
- we usually won't have an `"ElementValue"` at the root of questions
- that is because questions are automatically asked by the client. It gives little information on the user and are therefore not valuable as an `"ElementValue"`

## 3. Where can I see it in the documentation?

We had to actually integrate a video link in one steps of the example:
- in the Readme.md (https://github.com/GhostWording/gw-config-apis/blob/master/data/bot/readme.md), we added a paragraph 8.1.12 Elements and ElementValue under 8.1 Skeleton and elements of a sequence
